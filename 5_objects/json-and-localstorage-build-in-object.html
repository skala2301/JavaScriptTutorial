            A json object is an special javascript object usually used to send or receive data.
            On this example there is a text field and two buttons, the text entered is the name of a product,
            the product is an object and has other properties, the name is set to the one entered
            in the text field when pushing one of the buttons, 'Save to Local Storage', and the object is stored
            in the localStorage, if you push the button labeled 'Load Product from Storage' you get the stored object
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; margin-left: 10rem; margin-right: 10rem; place-content: flex-end center;">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Enter product name" id="input-name">
            <button id="set-prod-name">
                Save to Local Storage
            </button>
            <button id="get-prod-name">
                Load Product from Storage
            </button>
